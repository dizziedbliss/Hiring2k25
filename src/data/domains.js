We design posters, reels, carousels, and short edits that make college life look as exciting as it truly is. Whether you’re into snappy edits, subtle color grading, clever captions, or motion graphics, you’ll find your flow here. We use tools like Canva, Figma, Photoshop, and Premiere Pro, but what matters most is your eye for detail and the joy of creating something people love to share. If you’ve ever looked at a post and thought ‘I could make that cleaner,’ you’ll fit right in. We brainstorm together, iterate fast, and learn by doing — you’ll start small and level up quickly. If storytelling through visuals makes you happy, this is your zone.",

We explore React, Node.js, Python, basic APIs, and version control (Git), but more importantly, we learn how to think clearly and ship simple, working solutions. You’ll pair with seniors, contribute to mini-projects, and pick up best practices as you go. If you’ve ever felt the rush of getting something to finally run — welcome home.",
